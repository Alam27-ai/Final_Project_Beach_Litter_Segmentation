AI Computer Vision-based technology is proposed to segment objects on the beach, specifically natural litter and artificial litter. Several algorithms for object segmentation in this project are Resnet50-Unet and YOLOv8 segmentation models. Based on the study, YOLOv8x is best segmentation model for this project. the [dataset](https://www.seanoe.org/data/00743/85472/) in this project is an open-source dataset provided by Sugiyama, D., et al. (2022). The dataset contains 3500 images and masks, and 8 classes and for detailed explanation about this dataset is provided in the [journal article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340922002839) by the authors. Here are some additional links related to this project.
